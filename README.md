# Accident Prevention and Road Safety Model

## Overview

The **Accident Prevention and Road Safety Model** is a comprehensive solution designed to significantly reduce road accidents and enhance safety for both motorists and pedestrians. By integrating modern technologies such as **automated car braking systems**, **smart zebra crossings**, and **U-turn safety roads**, this project aims to provide a safer road environment and prevent accidents before they occur.

This project leverages technologies such as **IR sensors**, **servo motors**, **NodeMCU**, **LED lights**, and **audible alerts** to create a responsive and adaptive traffic management system.

## Key Features

### 1. **Automated Car Braking System**

- **IR sensors** detect obstacles in the vehicle's path, triggering automatic braking to avoid collisions.
- Provides real-time, split-second decisions to prevent accidents caused by human error, such as rear-end crashes.

### 2. **Smart Zebra Crossing**

- **IR sensors** detect pedestrians waiting to cross and activate **LED lights** to signal drivers.
- **Servo motors** are used to facilitate dynamic pedestrian management.
- Clear communication between drivers and pedestrians improves pedestrian safety.

### 3. **U-turn Safety Roads**

- **IR sensors** and **LED signals** warn drivers of approaching vehicles while performing U-turns.
- **Audible alerts** ensure drivers are aware of potential hazards.
- Aimed at reducing accidents at intersections with high U-turn traffic.

## Objective

- **Reduce Accidents**: Mitigate rear-end collisions and pedestrian accidents using automation and sensor technology.
- **Enhance Road Safety**: Provide real-time alerts to drivers and pedestrians to ensure a safer environment.
- **Promote Responsible Driving**: Encourage awareness through dynamic traffic management and responsive systems.

## Technologies Used

- **IR Sensors**: Used to detect obstacles and pedestrians in real-time.
- **Servo Motors**: Enable dynamic actions such as moving traffic signals or controlling zebra crossing gates.
- **NodeMCU (ESP8266)**: Provides Wi-Fi connectivity for real-time communication between components.
- **LED Lights**: Used for signaling both vehicles and pedestrians at crossings and intersections.
- **Audible Alerts**: Ensure that drivers are warned in critical situations.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main modules:

1. **Car Auto Brake System Module**: Automatically applies brakes when an obstacle is detected.
2. **Smart Zebra Crossing Module**: Manages pedestrian crossings and alerts drivers.
3. **U-turn Safety Module**: Provides warnings to drivers about approaching vehicles while making U-turns.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   - Clone the project to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Mahir-Bajole/Accident-Prevention-and-Road-Safety.git
     ```

2. **Set Up Hardware Components**

   - **NodeMCU (ESP8266)** for controlling and connecting sensors.
   - **IR Sensors** to detect obstacles and pedestrians.
   - **Servo Motors** for controlling gates or traffic lights.
   - **LED Lights** for signaling drivers.
   - **Buzzer or Alarm** for audible alerts.
   - Ensure all components are wired according to the circuit diagram provided in the project.

3. **Install Software and Libraries**

   - Use **Arduino IDE** or any compatible software for uploading code to the NodeMCU.
   - Install the necessary libraries (e.g., for **Servo Motors** and **IR Sensors**).

4. **Upload the Code**

   - Open the provided **Arduino code** in the Arduino IDE.
   - Connect your **NodeMCU** via USB and select the correct board and port.
   - Upload the code to the **NodeMCU**.

5. **Testing**
   - Once the hardware is set up and the code is uploaded, test the system by simulating different road conditions (e.g., a pedestrian trying to cross or a vehicle approaching from the rear).
   - Ensure that the automated car braking system, smart zebra crossing, and U-turn safety road systems are functioning as expected.

## Example Use Cases

- **Automated Braking**: When a vehicle approaches a stop sign or intersection too quickly, the system automatically applies the brakes to prevent a collision.
- **Pedestrian Safety**: As pedestrians approach the zebra crossing, the system activates lights and signals, alerting drivers to stop.
- **U-turn Safety**: Before executing a U-turn, drivers receive an alert if oncoming traffic is detected, reducing the risk of accidents.
